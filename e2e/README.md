# To mitigate flakiness in our E2E tests:

1 **Explicit Waits:** Used Playwright's built-in auto-waiting mechanisms (expect(locator).toBeVisible()) rather than arbitrary timeouts

2 **Atomic Selectors**: Used text-based locators combined with specific attributes for reliability

3 **Test Isolation**: Each test runs in a clean context (Playwright handles this by default)

4 **Retry Mechanism**: Configured Playwright to retry failed tests (set in playwright.config.js)


# For test failure reporting:

1 **Automatic Screenshots**: Playwright automatically captures screenshots on failure

2 **Video Recording**: Enabled video recording for all tests (configured in playwright.config.js)

3 **Trace Viewer**: Use Playwright's trace viewer (npx playwright show-trace) for step-by-step debugging

4 **CI Integration**: Failures would be reported through:

- CI system notifications (Slack/Email)

- Test summary in pull request comments

- Dedicated test reporting dashboard if using services like GitHub Actions or CircleCI

# CI Integration

1 **Pre-commit Hook**: Optional (could run smoke tests)

2 **Pull Request Pipeline**:

- Install dependencies

- Build application

- Run E2E tests in headless mode

- Upload artifacts (screenshots, videos) on failure

3 **Main Branch Protection**: Require passing E2E tests before merge

4 **Nightly Runs**: Full suite with more browsers/device emulation
